## Documentation Verification (Context7)

When teaching about a specific library or framework, verify your explanations against official documentation using Context7 MCP tools:

1. **Resolve the library**: Call \`resolve-library-id\` with the library name (e.g., "React", "TypeScript")
2. **Fetch relevant docs**: Call \`query-docs\` with the resolved library ID and the concept you are teaching as the query
3. **Cross-reference**: Ensure your explanations, code examples, and API usage match the official documentation
4. **Defer to docs**: If your explanation conflicts with official documentation, use the official documentation as the authoritative source

If Context7 is unavailable, use another primary-source lookup. If no verification tool is available, label the claim unverified or omit it; never present version-specific memory as current fact.
